We started by learning. More about Pyverilog and about its data structure and how to add, remove, adjust cells. After reading the documentation of pyverilog, We were able to start coding by reading the Verilog file and parsing the required cells and adjusting it till we reached the output of out program which is TestUpdated.v

TestUpdated.v replaced the multiplexer with the clock gate and adjust all the required wire supporting the sky130A pdk which enhances the power consumption of the circuit.
